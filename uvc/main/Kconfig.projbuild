            help
                JPEG compression quality percentage (1-100).

                Higher values produce better image quality but larger data streams:
                - 90-100: Excellent quality, high bandwidth usage
                - 70-90: Good quality, moderate bandwidth (recommended for UVC)
                - 50-70: Acceptable quality, lower bandwidth
                - 1-50: Poor quality, minimal bandwidth

                For UVC streaming, consider the USB bandwidth limitations
                and host system capabilities when choosing quality level.

                Recommended: 80 for balanced quality and performance.

        config EXAMPLE_H264_I_PERIOD
            int "H.264 Intra Frame period (frames)"

            range 1 120
            help
                Number of frames between Intra (I) frames in the H.264 stream.

                I-frames are complete, independently decodable frames that serve
                as reference points for the video stream.

                Smaller values (10-30):
                - Better seek performance and error recovery
                - Higher bandwidth usage
                - Better for streaming applications with packet loss

                Larger values (60-120):
                - Better compression efficiency
                - Lower bandwidth usage
                - Suitable for stable connections

                For UVC streaming, moderate values (60-120) balance compression
                efficiency with error recovery capabilities.

        config EXAMPLE_H264_BITRATE
            int "H.264 Target bitrate (bps)"
            default 1000000
            range 25000 2500000
            help
                Target bitrate for H.264 encoding in bits per second.

                Bitrate directly affects both quality and bandwidth usage:
                - 500,000 bps (500 kbps): Low quality, minimal bandwidth
                - 1,000,000 bps (1 Mbps): Good quality, moderate bandwidth (recommended)
                - 2,000,000 bps (2 Mbps): High quality, higher bandwidth
                - 5,000,000+ bps (5+ Mbps): Very high quality, maximum bandwidth

                Consider USB bandwidth limitations:
                - USB 2.0: ~35 MB/s theoretical, ~20 MB/s practical
                - USB 3.0+: Much higher bandwidth available

                Choose based on your USB interface and host capabilities.

        config EXAMPLE_H264_MIN_QP
            int "H.264 Minimum quantization parameter (QP)"
            default 25
            range 1 51
            help
                Minimum quantization parameter for H.264 encoding.

                Lower QP values produce higher quality (and larger bitrates).
                This sets the highest quality limit the encoder can achieve.

                Quantization scale:
                - 1-18: Lossless to very high quality
                - 19-23: High quality (recommended minimum for streaming)
                - 24-28: Good quality
                - 29+: Lower quality

                For UVC streaming, values 18-25 provide good quality while
                maintaining reasonable bandwidth requirements.

                Must be less than maximum QP value.

        config EXAMPLE_H264_MAX_QP
            int "H.264 Maximum quantization parameter (QP)"
            default 26
            range 1 51
            help
                Maximum quantization parameter for H.264 encoding.

                Higher QP values produce lower quality (and smaller bitrates).
                This sets the lowest quality limit to maintain target bitrate.

                Quantization scale:
                - 23-28: High to good quality
                - 29-35: Good to acceptable quality (recommended maximum)
                - 36-45: Acceptable to poor quality
                - 46-51: Poor quality

                For UVC streaming, the encoder will adjust QP between minimum
                and maximum values to maintain the target bitrate while
                preserving acceptable quality.

                Must be greater than or equal to minimum QP value.
